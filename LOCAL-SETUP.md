# How to Create a Local WordPress Site (Step-by-Step)

**I cannot create the site for you** because Local requires manual clicking in its GUI.  
But I've made this guide as simple as possible. **Follow these exact steps:**

## Step 1: Open Local App
1. Click the Windows Start button
2. Type "Local"
3. Click on "Local" app to open it

## Step 2: Click the "+" Button
1. Look at the **bottom-left corner** of the Local window
2. You'll see a big **green "+"** button
3. Click it

## Step 3: Enter Site Name
1. A popup appears asking "What's your site's name?"
2. Type: `Banking-Demo`
3. Click **"Continue"**

## Step 4: Choose Environment
1. It will ask "Choose your environment"
2. Click **"Preferred"** (the recommended option)
3. Click **"Continue"**

## Step 5: Set WordPress Details
1. It will ask for WordPress username and password
2. Enter:
   - **Username:** `admin`
   - **Password:** `password`
   - **Email:** (any email, e.g., `admin@local.test`)
3. Click **"Add Site"**

## Step 6: Wait for Installation
1. Local will now install WordPress (this takes 1-2 minutes)
2. You'll see a progress bar
3. Wait until it says "Site created successfully!"

## Step 7: Verify the Site is Running
1. You should see "Banking-Demo" in the left sidebar
2. Next to it, there should be a **green dot** (this means it's running)
3. If you see an **orange dot**, click it to start the site

##Done!

**Once you complete these steps, tell me:**  
> "I have created the site"

Then I will **automatically deploy your Banking Application** to it! 🚀

## Troubleshooting

**Q: I don't see the "+" button**  
A: Make sure you have Local fully loaded. It should show a sidebar on the left.

**Q: The installation failed**  
A: Try again, or use a different name like `Banking-App-Test`.

**Q: I already have a site**  
A: That's fine! Just tell me the name of your site and I'll deploy to it.
